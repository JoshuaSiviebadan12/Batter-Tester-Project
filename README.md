# Battery-Tester-Project
This project is a battery tester arduino project that is used to test the voltages within an battery that is greater than 8v. This project uses an arudino uno, 3 100 ohm resistors, 1 2.2k ohm resitor, a 5.1v zener diode, breadboard jumper wires, a breadboard and 3 leds. The zener diode is used to only allow the current to travel in one direction until it hits the breakdown voltage. This is used to ensure that the parts used in this project don't get damaged due to too much voltage which certain parts can't handle. The 2.2k resistor is used to reduce the current coming from the battery to ensure that the ardunio doesn't get damaged. The leds will light up a certain colour depending on the level of charge the battery has. If it is almost fully charged the led will light up green, if it is about half full then the led will light up yellow, and if the battery is almost dead then the led will light up red. One wire that is connected to ground and another wire that is connected to the zener diode will be used as pins to make connections to the positive and negative terminals of the battery to test its charge.
